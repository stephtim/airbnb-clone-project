# airbnb-clone-project
This repository gives a full in depth look into the process of creating a real world application to simulate the development of a proper  booking platform. 
This project is a learning process in which the backend process of developing a versatileapplication which is robust and scalable.The project will showcase a foundation for managing user interactions,property listings, bookings and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core feature of Airbnb,ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.
# Project Goals
## User Management 
Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication and profile management.
## Property Management
Develop features for property listing creation, updates and retrieval.
## Booking Sytem
Creating a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
## Payment Procesing
Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
## Review System
Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
## Data Optimization
Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimization.

# Team Roles
## BUSINESS ANALYST
-Understands cutomer's business processes.
-Translate customers business needs into requirements.
A BA enriches a product development team with a profound understanding of business processes from various perspectives and the ability to shape up a software product that creates maximum business value. A business analyst may step in even before a software development team structure is defined and continue to bridge the gap between the customer and the team during later stages of development.

## PRODUCT OWNER
-Holds responsibility for a product vision and evolution
-Makes sure the final product meets customer requirements
A product owner provides the vision of a product without diving deep into how it is technically implemented.
Holding more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development team member, a product owner is a decision-maker. 

## PROJECT MANAGER
-Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget
-Manages and motivates the software development team
In sequential models, a project manager is responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.

## UI/UX DESIGNER
-Transforms a product vision into user-friendly designs
-Creates user journeys for the best user experience and highest conversion rates
A UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. A UX designer is thus involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more.

## SOFTWARE ARCHITECT
-Designs a high-level software architecture
-Selects appropriate tools and platforms to implement the product vision
-Sets up code quality standards and performs code reviews
A software architect decides which services and databases should communicate together, how integrations should work, and how to ensure that the product is secure and stable.

## SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
-Engineers and stabilizes the product
-Solves any technical problems emerging during the development lifecycle
Front-end developers create the part of an application that users interact with, ensuring that an app offers an equally smooth experience to all—no matter the device, platform, or operational system.
Back-end developers, in turn, implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER
-Makes sure an application performs according to requirements
-Spots functional and non-functional defects
The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it should do that. 

## TEST AUTOMATION ENGINEER
-Designs a test automation ecosystem
-Writes and maintains test scripts for automated testing
A test automation engineer is there to help you test faster and better. To enable that, they develop test automation scripts—small programs that provide reliable and continuous feedback on application quality without any human involvement.

## DevOp ENGINEER
-Facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams
-Builds continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for faster delivery
DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.
